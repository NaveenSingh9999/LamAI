## Features

- **History Knowledge**: LamAI is trained on a vast dataset of historical events, figures, and timelines, providing accurate and detailed information.
- **Geography Expertise**: The model includes comprehensive knowledge of geographical data, including countries, capitals, landmarks, and more.
- **Question Answering**: Utilizing the Stanford SQuAD dataset, LamAI can answer a wide range of questions with high accuracy.
- **Custom Neural Network**: LamAI employs a proprietary neural network architecture optimized for historical and geographical data processing.
- **Fully Offline**: The model can operate entirely offline, ensuring data privacy and security.
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: LamAI continuously learns from a diverse set of data sources, including text files, PDFs, Python scripts, and C++ files.
- **Decision-Making Power**: Advanced algorithms enable LamAI to make informed decisions based on the processed data.
- **Trainable Model**: Users can retrain LamAI with their own datasets to improve performance or adapt to new tasks.
- **Open Source**: The project is open source, encouraging community contributions and transparency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Access to the training datasets

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NaveenSingh9999/LamAI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd LamAI
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Training the Model

### Data Preparation

1. **History and Geography Data**: Ensure you have the datasets for history and geography. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own.
2. **Stanford SQuAD Dataset**: Download the Stanford SQuAD dataset from [here](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).

### Training Process

1. Preprocess the data:
   - Store/Plot All Your Datasets (txt,pdf,py,cpp) In ```Training_data``` Folder.

3. Train the model:
   - Train And Start Your Model Using This Commamd.
    ```python
    python lamai.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to answer questions or provide information on history and geography.

### Example

```python
from lamai import LamAI

model = LamAI(model_path='./models/lamai_model.pth')
response = model.answer_question("Who was the first president of the United States?")
print(response)
```

## Working of Neural Network

LamAI's neural network is designed to process historical and geographical data efficiently. It consists of multiple layers, including:

- **Input Layer**: Takes in the raw data.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant parts of the input.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final predictions.

## Functions in lamai.py

The `lamai.py` file contains several key functions:

- `__init__(self, model_path)`: Initializes the LamAI model.
- `load_model(self)`: Loads the pre-trained model from the specified path.
- `preprocess_input(self, input_text)`: Preprocesses the input text for the model.
- `answer_question(self, question)`: Generates an answer to the given question.
- `evaluate(self, validation_data)`: Evaluates the model's performance on validation data.
